# Hapax-Legomena
A program that lists the hapax legomena from a given data file

Our tool will tally how many occurrences of each word there are in each data file presented on the command line, but our
underlying objective is to list the hapax legomena. Each hapax legomenon (the singular form of this term) is a word that
occurs only once in an entire document
